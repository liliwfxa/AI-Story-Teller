# AI-Story-Teller
Our application generates stories for children of various age groups and displays them in a book format, complete with generated text and images, and also narrates these stories. Additionally, it includes the option of voice cloning for a personalized storytelling experience.

If the application doesn't work, there might be a need to create a directory - "generated_books".

Lessons Learned:

What went well in our project was the robustness of the story generation based on user prompts, the high quality and contextual accuracy of the image generation, and the functionality allowing users to save their favorite stories or delete ones they did not like. These features combined to provide a highly customizable and user-friendly experience.
What could have been better in our project was reducing the time it took to generate stories. Faster story generation would have significantly enhanced user engagement by delivering instant gratification and a smoother, more responsive storytelling experience.
For challenges, one area we focused on improving was our prompt engineering for image generation. Initially, the images generated were sometimes irrelevant or inconsistent with the context of the stories. By refining the prompts and incorporating more specific descriptors and context, we were able to achieve a higher quality and relevance in the images produced, enhancing the overall coherence of the story visuals.
The following are key areas of focus for future development:

Adding an array of different voice for users to choose from.
Allowing users to download in PDF format.
Improving the inference speed.
Implementing User authentication.
User-centric customizations and interactions.
